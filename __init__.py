"""Crew: kanban roles with a contract, one writer per card and independent verification.

The owner's surface is five entries:

  /crew <what you want>   intake by the coordinator in this chat (the `crew` skill). It checks
                          the ask critically, asks numbered questions while any contract field is
                          missing and opens the card (kanban_create, guarded and completed by this
                          plugin) only once the contract is complete, then the turn ends.
  /crew-status            the cards in flight, each with the coordinator's last decision and, when a
                          card waits on the owner, its one question.
  /crew-graph <card>      one card's flow graph: terminal box graph, two frames apart (--watch), or an
                          HTML file (--html).
  /crew-stop [<card>]     park one card, or every open crew card: worker killed, card held, history kept
                          (--archive drops one card for good).
  /crew-unstuck <card>    the owner's fallback when the coordinator gave up: a triage card leaves triage
                          unchanged, a blocked card (or one /crew-stop parked) is unblocked.
  /crew-diagnose [state]  a skill like the intake, so it runs in the invoking session's own turn: every
                          card in one board state with its id and reason, then how each would resume.
                          Read-only - it diagnoses, it never retries, unblocks or dispatches.

The plugin commands (/crew-status, /crew-graph, /crew-stop, /crew-unstuck) are deterministic and make no model call, and
each option is its own command, so the command list in /help and in every platform menu IS the option
list. Install and role checks are not commands: `python3 <crew repo>/install.py --check [--profile P]`
(`hermes plugins doctor` only validates that a plugin loads and registers; it prints nothing about roles,
crons or profile drift).

`/crew` is owned by the skill: a plugin slash command is always handled before skills and its
handler can only return text (gateway/run_inbound.py and cli.py treat any registered plugin
command as handled), so the plugin registers `crew-status`, `crew-graph` and `crew-stop`, never `crew`.

Once a card is open the coordinator owns it: the dispatch-tick hook below starts
scripts/crew_coordinator.py (one detached pass, no model unless a card needs a decision) and that pass heals,
retries, rescopes, splits or asks the owner one question. Nothing else routes a blocked card anywhere.

In role profiles (config `crew.role` set by the installer) the plugin also enforces the per-card
token budget as a hard stop and, for the verifier, blocks write/send commands on the terminal.
Roles come from $HERMES_HOME/roles/crew/roles.json; the installer records the package source
under `crew.source_dir`, which the scripts use to find the package when an installed copy lacks one.
