"""Proof that every crew option is a slash command of its own, in the registry Hermes reads.

The option is in the command name, so the command list is the option list:

  1. the plugin source carries one row per option and registers a command for each row
  2. loading the installed plugin and registering it against a stub host yields exactly the option
     commands and nothing else, each with a description, none of them the commands that were removed
     (/crew-run, /crew-verify, /crew-roles, /crew-install, /crew-ops and the passes the coordinator loop
     replaced) and none named `crew` (the intake stays a skill, so `/crew <ask>` still reaches the model)
  3. every option handler runs and returns text - /crew-graph in its plain mode and in each of its
     two flag modes (--watch, --html) - and the whole-board stop pass is exercised with --dry-run
     so this proof mutates nothing
  4. /crew-status lists exactly the crew cards in flight of the board it reads, each with its id
  5. the live Hermes registry resolves every one of them to the crew plugin, and the manifest
     declares every hook the plugin actually registers

Run:  python3 crew_option_commands_proof.py
Exit: 0 when every check passes, 1 otherwise.
