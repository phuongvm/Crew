"""Proof that a crew card can carry the model the router picked, and that the dispatcher honours it.

Option 1 of the model routing ask: the coordinator asks the one model router for a pick and pins it
on the card, so each role runs the model Jev decided instead of every role sitting on one provider.

  1. crew_card.py open --model/--provider reaches `hermes kanban create --model/--provider`
  2. the kanban CLI really takes --model/--provider (and refuses --provider without --model)
  3. the dispatcher's spawn line asks the routing hook first; with nothing routed, a pinned card
     carries -m <model> --provider (the card's own pin, unchanged behind the hook)
  4. with nothing routed, an unpinned card carries neither (the profile default still stands)
  4b. a routed answer wins over the pin: a stale pin cannot outlive the pick made at spawn time
  5. the router's pick for a crew card comes from its agent-floor menu (provider + model + floor), or is
     "parent" - no pick, no pin - when nothing on that menu is live
  6. the pick is written onto the card: model_override, provider_override, and a 'route' event
  7. no router on the box -> no pick and no pin (nothing is invented)

Run:  python3 crew_route_pin_proof.py
Exit: 0 when every check passes, 1 otherwise.
