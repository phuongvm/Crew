Crew is a plugin for [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) that turns one chat
message into verified work on the Hermes kanban board.

```
/crew launch the Pro plan: pricing page, Stripe checkout, launch post and email
```

Crew asks only what it needs to deliver a good result (five questions at most, often none), writes a
**card contract** - goal, artifact, where it lands, *done when*, a **proof command**, a token budget - and
hands the card to a **coordinator** that owns it until the proof command exits 0. You get the verified
result back in the same chat, or one concrete question when it truly needs you.

## Why

| | |
|---|---|
| **One ask** | `/crew <ask>` is the only thing you type. Normal chat stays untouched. |
| **Up to six cards in parallel** | One ask fans out into independent cards, one writer each. |
| **Done means proven** | A card cannot be marked done until its proof command passes - enforced by a tool guard, in every profile. |
| **An owner for every card** | The coordinator heals, retries, rescopes or splits a stuck card, and asks you only when it needs you. |
| **Hard budgets** | Every card carries a token budget; a run that reaches it stops instead of burning on. |
| **See everything** | A local dashboard shows every card, run, session, tool call and verdict, live. |
| **Self-hosted** | Runs inside your own Hermes, on your own machine. No telemetry. |

## Install

Requires Hermes Agent **0.21.5 or newer** with the kanban board, and Python 3.11+. The plugin declares
`requires_hermes: ">=0.21.5"`, so an older Hermes refuses to load it instead of failing half-way. From 0.8.0 crew
runs on Hermes's package-manager dependency layout (the gateway's bare interpreter plus a committed venv) as well
as the older in-tree venv; 0.7.x only knew the latter, and a `hermes update` onto the new layout broke its proofs.

```sh
# 1. get the plugin
hermes plugins install macd2/Crew

# 2. set it up for your chat profile (role profiles, the dashboard service)
python3 ~/.hermes/plugins/crew/install.py --profile NAME

# 3. check it
python3 ~/.hermes/plugins/crew/install.py --check --profile NAME
hermes -p NAME plugins doctor crew
```

`NAME` is the profile you chat with (`default` if you do not use profiles). Running the installer twice
changes nothing; `--check` is a dry run that prints exactly what would change. The installer never asks
anything and never approves a shell hook for you.

### What `install.py` changes

By default:

- **Role profiles.** Creates `crew-coordinator`, `crew-worker`, `crew-content` and `crew-verifier` with
  `hermes profile create --clone-from NAME`. Hermes has no partial clone, so each role profile gets a copy of
  your profile's `config.yaml` (including its `hooks:`), its whole `.env` (provider keys), `SOUL.md`, skills
  and memories (`MEMORY.md`, `USER.md`); Hermes strips the messaging channels. Then, in each role profile:
  - sets the keys from `templates/profiles/<role>/settings.conf` with `hermes config set`. Models are
    Anthropic's, and `model.base_url` is pinned to `https://api.anthropic.com`: edit the template before
    installing to use your own;
  - replaces `SOUL.md` with the role's persona (only while it is still the shipped one);
  - deletes every skill that is not crew's, printing each path. This only happens in a role profile crew
    created (it carries `crew/template-shipped.json`);
  - installs the plugin, skills and roles file, and runs `plugins enable crew --no-allow-tool-override`.
- **Your profile.** Copies the plugin (with its `scripts/`) to `<profile>/plugins/crew/`, the skills to
  `skills/crew/` and the roles file to `roles/crew/`; sets `crew.roles_path` and `crew.source_dir`; records
  the owner profile in `~/.hermes/crew/owner.json`.
- **Other profiles that already have crew.** Each is updated to the same version (plugin, skills, roles), and
  every update is printed. Profiles without crew are not touched.
- **Old copies.** Deletes the crew scripts earlier versions put in `<profile>/scripts/`, only the files crew
  shipped, printing each one, and retires the old self-heal and observer cron jobs.
- **Dashboard.** Writes and starts the user service `crew-graph-http` (`Restart=always`), bound to
  `127.0.0.1:8799` (`--graph-port N`). `--no-service` skips it.

Only when you ask for it:

| Flag | What it adds |
|---|---|
| `--nightly-proofs` | A Hermes cron job at 03:00 that runs the proof suite and speaks only on a failure, plus the shim `<profile>/scripts/crew_proofs_nightly.py` (Hermes cron runs scripts from there only, and runs a `.py` one with Hermes's own interpreter, which the proofs need; an older `crew_proofs.sh` shim is migrated and removed). Output stays local unless `--proofs-deliver TARGET`. |
| `--chat-kanban` | Enables the kanban toolset on the zulip and telegram platforms of your profile. |
| `--telegram-menu` | Puts the crew commands first in your Telegram command menu. |
| `--spill-cap` | Sets `hooks.output_spill.max_chars` on your profile, so the `/crew` intake reads its brief in one tool call. |
| `--publish` | Serves the dashboard on your tailnet with `tailscale serve` (tailnet only, never the internet). Only one tailnet login gets in (`--publish-user LOGIN`, or the tailnet's single human login; otherwise it refuses), plus devices with a tag from `--publish-tag` (a tagged device carries no login). |

The installer reports shell hooks your profiles declare but you have not approved. It never approves them:
review them with `hermes -p P hooks list` and confirm them at Hermes's own prompt.

## Use

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/crew <ask>` | The intake: asks what is missing, writes the contract, opens the card(s). |
| *(reply to a crew report)* | Answer the card-ended message crew posts into your chat with "rework it" and the intake runs for a follow-up card, no `/crew` retyped (your next message only, within 30 min). |
| `/crew-status` | Cards in flight, the coordinator's last decision, any question for you. No model call. |
| `/crew-graph <card\|latest>` | One card's flow graph in the terminal (`--watch N`, `--html`). No model call. |
| `/crew-stop [<card>]` | Park one card, or every open crew card: worker killed, card held with its history, nothing archived. `--archive <card>` drops one for good. No model call. |
| `/crew-unstuck <card>` | Put a card the coordinator gave up on, or one you parked with `/crew-stop`, back in the queue (out of triage unchanged, or unblocked). No model call. |
| `/crew-safety [brave\|safe]` | Show or set how careful unattended proof commands are (see below). No model call. |
| `/crew-proof <card> <yes\|brave>` | Answer a card's proof question: `yes` accepts a proposed proof command, `brave` runs a blocked one. No model call. |
| `/crew-diagnose [state]` | Read-only: every card in that state, why it is there and how it would resume. |

Or paste this into an agent and let it set crew up for you:

```
Set up Hermes.Crew for my Hermes profile NAME: from the Hermes.Crew package run python3 install.py --profile NAME,
then hermes -p NAME plugins doctor crew and fix anything it reports. Finish by sending /crew-status in my chat
and tell me what it answered.
```

## Lessons

What agents learn on a card lives in `<base home>/crew/lessons.md`, one dated line per lesson with the roles it
applies to. It is never shipped and the installer and `crew_parity_check` leave it alone. Agents record a lesson
with `python3 "$HERMES_HOME/plugins/crew/scripts/crew_card.py" lesson --role content,verifier --text "..."`
(identical lessons are stored once; the newest 50 entries / 8 KB are kept); editing a crew skill with
`skill_manage` is refused in every profile, because an installed skill is overwritten by the next install. The
The plugin adds a role's lessons (and the `all` ones) to that role's turn, and the `all` ones to `/crew`'s intake.
An agent may not write `--role all` lessons (that is the owner's intake channel); it tags its own role and the
owner promotes it. To make a lesson permanent, move it into the matching `skills/*/SKILL.md` in a release and delete it from the file.

## Proof safety

A proof command is a shell command, and crew runs it unattended. When the intake shows you the proof, it asks
once:

```
Proof commands run unattended. How careful should crew be?

  1) Hermes safety (default): a flagged command (rm, chmod, a download piped into a shell, ...)
     stops the card and asks you.
  2) Be brave 🫡 (YOLO): nothing stops a proof except Hermes's hardline list
     (wiping the root, formatting a disk, fork bombs). Crew will happily rm what the proof says.
     Your call, your disk.
```

- **The command you confirm is the only one that runs.** It is saved when the card opens. Editing the card,
  or a coordinator rescope, cannot change it; a new proof needs your yes again.
- **Hermes decides what is dangerous.** Crew uses Hermes's own checks: the hardline list and your
  `approvals.deny` rules always block; in safe mode Hermes's dangerous-command and tirith checks block too.
  If the proof you are confirming would be flagged, the card opens in safe mode and the coordinator asks you;
  answer `/crew-proof <card> brave` to run it for that card. The intake's own `Proof mode` / `Proof approved`
  body lines are ignored for a flagged command, so a model cannot approve it on your behalf.
- **Proofs run with a clean environment.** Provider and tool keys are stripped, the same way Hermes's
  terminal tool does it.
- **`/crew-safety brave` stops the question for good.** It sets Hermes's `approvals.mode: off` in the crew
  role profiles, which also lets the workers' own terminal commands run unprompted. `/crew-safety safe` puts
  back the value each profile had before.

Proof scripts are model-written (by the verifier role, never by the writer). The command that runs them is
owner-confirmed; the script runs with a scrubbed environment, is bound by hash after its first run, and changes only
through a coordinator decision carried out by the verifier. Hermes's command checks see the command, not the script's
content.

## Reports

Crew reports back into the chat a card came from, through Hermes's own `hermes send` (any platform Hermes is
connected to), and only when there is something to say: one report when a card is done, one message per new
question for you, one line if a card is abandoned. Blocks, retries and heals the coordinator is handling stay
silent.

## How a card travels

```
you ──/crew──▶ intake ──contract──▶ coordinator ──▶ writer (worker | content) ──▶ proof ──▶ verifier ──▶ you
                (asks what is        (owns the card,    (one per card,            (exit 0 is    (runs the proof
                 missing, once)       every stop gets    inside the scope)         the only      itself, never
                                      one decision)                                pass)         trusts a summary)
```

The full design - the contract fields, the close rule, verification modes, the coordinator's decisions,
the dashboard and the role profiles - is in [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).

## Configuration

Everything works with no configuration. Optional environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `CREW_OWNER_PROFILE` | the profile `install.py` was run for | the chat profile cards are opened from and reported to |
| `CREW_DASHBOARD_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8799` (or the `--publish` URL) | the board link used in messages |

## Uninstall

```sh
hermes plugins disable crew && hermes plugins remove crew
systemctl --user disable --now crew-graph-http.service
```

The role profiles stay until you remove them (`hermes profile delete crew-worker`, ...). With
`--nightly-proofs`, also remove the cron job (`hermes cron list`, `hermes cron remove <id>`) and
`<profile>/scripts/crew_proofs_nightly.py`.
